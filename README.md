# check_uppercase
this program check whether all the characters are uppercase or not.
# decimal to binary
this program takes a value of decimal and gives it in binary
# Collatz Sequence
the following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
# square number
this program checks whether the given number is perfect square number or not
# Hidden number
Given an array of integers, find another integer such that, if all the elements of the array are subtracted individually from that number, then the sum of all the differences should add to 0. If any such integer exists, print its value otherwise print '-1'.
Input:
3
1 2 3
where:
First line represents the number of elements in the array.
Second line represents the elements in the array.
Output:
2
Explanation: Substracting all the elements of arrays from 2, The sum of difference is: 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0.
# palindrome
A string is said to be a palindrome if the original string and the reverse of the string are the same. MALAYALAM is a plaindrome.
this is a program that takes a string (character array) and displays 1 if string is palindrome else 0. 
Input:
 level 
Output:
 1 
# sum execpt smallest and largest
Given a list, find the sum of numbers excluding largest and smallest one. If there are multiple smallest value, exclude just one, and likewise for the largest value. 
this is a function solution that accepts a list.
Input:
    9 
    4 3 6 8 9 2 1 5 9
    Where, 
First line represents the size of the list, N.
The second line represents list elements separated by single space. All the elements of the list should be on a single line.
Output:
     37
# insert an element at index k
Given an array of integers, write a program to insert an element X at index K.
Input:
    5
    10 20 30 40 50
    15
    1  
    where:
First line represents the number of elements in the array.
Second line represents the elements in the array.
Third line represents element X to be inserted.
Fourth line represents the index K, where the element is to be inserted.

Output:
    10 15 20 30 40 50
Explanation: Output displays the elements of the array after inserting the element X=15 at index K=1.
