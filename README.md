# check_uppercase
this program check whether all the characters are uppercase or not.
# decimal to binary
this program takes a value of decimal and gives it in binary
# Collatz Sequence
the following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
n → n/2 (n is even)
n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
# square number
this program checks whether the given number is perfect square number or not
# Hidden number
Given an array of integers, find another integer such that, if all the elements of the array are subtracted individually from that number, then the sum of all the differences should add to 0. If any such integer exists, print its value otherwise print '-1'.
Input:
3
1 2 3
where:
First line represents the number of elements in the array.
Second line represents the elements in the array.
Output:
2
Explanation: Substracting all the elements of arrays from 2, The sum of difference is: 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0.
